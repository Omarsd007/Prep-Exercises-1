# WEEK 2
1. Which way of representing the traffic light did you find better? Why?

I think the second one since it is more readable. 

2. What happens if you change the loop to a do-while loop instead of a while loop? Why?

I tried, but nothing happened since at the beginning of the execution the values of the variables 'rotation' and 'cycle' are smaller than the condition. 
However, I know that using a do while loop is a bit risky because even if the condition in the loop is not met, the loop runs at least once.
If the values of cycle or rotation were greater than condition then do while loop would be executed even if the condition holded false.


3. We could have also used a for loop to make the traffic light do 2 full rotations. Do you think that would be better? Why or why not?
No,I don't think so . We can use both while and for loop . They do the same work .
